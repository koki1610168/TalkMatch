> ## Motivation

One of the problems we have when we learn a second language is that it takes too much money and efforts to register. Also, the online learning is always passive. If we were to experience both the learner and teacher, we will be able to learn more efficiently and faster. This website allows you to find a match in a few seconds and a start conversations. There is no need for registration, this website is self-contained so it's safe.
